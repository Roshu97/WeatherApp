# Environment Variables Configuration

This file documents the environment variables used in the Weather App deployment.

## Render Deployment Environment Variables

### API Configuration

#### OPENWEATHER_API_KEY
- **Description:** API key for OpenWeatherMap API
- **Type:** String
- **Required:** Yes
- **Current Value:** `8cdab3da013f0f5842b2eeae466dc39d`
- **Usage:** Used for fetching weather data and AQI information
- **Scope:** Public deployment only

### How to Add Environment Variables in Render

1. Navigate to your Web Service in Render Dashboard
2. Click on "Environment" tab
3. Click "Add Environment Variable"
4. Enter the variable name and value
5. Click "Save"
6. Render will automatically redeploy your service

### Security Best Practices

⚠️ **Important:** Never commit actual API keys to GitHub if they're sensitive!

#### Current Setup:
- API key is hardcoded in `app.js` (for demo purposes)
- Suitable for free/non-production APIs with low quotas
- Consider rotating keys regularly

#### Recommended for Production:
- Use environment variables instead of hardcoding
- Create a backend proxy to hide API keys
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Implement rate limiting on backend
- Monitor API usage and costs

### Using Environment Variables in Render

To use environment variables in your static site:

1. **During Build Phase:**
   - Create a build script that injects variables into JavaScript
   - Use Node.js to process files before deployment

2. **Client-Side (Not Recommended):**
   - Environment variables are not directly accessible from frontend
   - This is why we use a backend proxy instead

### Example: Backend Proxy Setup

If you want to add a backend proxy later, use this structure:

```
WeatherApp/
├── frontend/           # Static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── app.js
├── backend/            # Node.js/Python server
│   ├── server.js
│   └── package.json
└── render.yaml        # Render configuration
```

### Deployment Variables Checklist

- [ ] API Key is valid and active
- [ ] API Key has necessary permissions
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Render
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Application logs show no errors
- [ ] API calls are working after deployment

### Monitoring and Alerts

In Render Dashboard:
1. Go to your service
2. Set up email notifications for deployment failures
3. Monitor application logs for errors
4. Check API quota usage in OpenWeatherMap dashboard
